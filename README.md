Marketing selling constitute a typical strategy to enhance business. Companies not only use direct marketing when targeting segments of customers by contacting them to meet a specific goal, but also through various indirect channels, telephone (fixed-line or mobile) being one of the most widely used. Using data driven methods like the machine learning techniques, it is more efficient and effective for the companies to grasp the information of their customers, thus improving their selling process. In this paper, we use data driven methods to predict the success of bank telemarketing and learn which kind of customers are more likely to buy the products. 

We analyze a recent and large dataset (45,211 records) from a Portuguese bank. The data were collected from 2008 to 2013, thus including the effects of the global financial crisis that peaked in 2008. We compare four Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network and SVM) using a AUC-ROC and classification metric. We find that the best model (Random Forest) could most accurately predict the possibility of the customers buying the products of the bank. 

It is without a shadow of doubt that there are several classification models appropriate for the setting of our problem, such as the classical Logistic Regression (LR),  Random Forest (RF), the more recent Neural Networks (NNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). RF, NN and SVM are more flexible (i.e., no a priori restriction is imposed) when compared with classical statistical modeling (e.g., LR) presenting learning capabilities that range from linear to complex nonlinear mappings. Due to such flexibility, RF,NN and SVM tend to provide more accurate predictions, but the obtained models are difficult to be understood by humans, which is a loss of interpretability. In this paper, a binary classification task was modeled using the four machine learning algorithm that was fed with 16 attributes (after a feature selection step), using 4/5 randomly selected customers for training and 1/5 for testing. In the training samples, we cross validated for different models.
